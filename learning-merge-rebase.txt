1. Search and re-familiar on the concept of Merge & Rebase
  - Git merge: Merge combines two branches by creating a new merge commit. This method preserves the entire 
    commit history, including the points where the branches diverged and merged.
  - Rebase moves or reapplies commits from one branch onto the top of another branch, creating a cleaner, 
    linear history. This method "rewrites" history by creating new commits based on the original commits.

2. Pros and cons of merge and rebase
  - Merge:
    + Pros: The commit history is maintained, accurately reflecting (phản ánh) the development process of the project.
    + Cons: It can create many merge commits, making the history more complex and harder to follow.
  - Rebase:
    + Pros: It avoids creating multiple merge commits, keeping the history cleaner, help to easier follow 
      and understand
    + Cons: Rebase changes older commits, which can cause problems if the branch has already been shared 
      with others (push onto the origin).
