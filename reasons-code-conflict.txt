*** The reasons for code conflicts:
  - Changes to the Same Line: If two developers modify the same line or block of code in the same file, 
    Git can't automatically merge these changes. A conflict will arise, and Git will ask the developer 
    to manually resolve it.
  - Rebasing and Merging
  - Renaming Files
  - Deleting a File and Modifying It
